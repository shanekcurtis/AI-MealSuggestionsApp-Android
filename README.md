# Meal Suggestions App

This app, which was developed as a group project for our CS414 Mobile App Development final, is an AI-Powered Meal Suggestions app built for Android. 

This project uses OpenAI's 3.5 turbo Chat API to take an input list of ingredients from the user, an optional "nationality of influence" and outputs multiple meal suggestions for the user to prepare.

The Meal Suggestions App is built with an MVVM structure, and uses a Room database to store/read/delete saved meals that the AI suggests.
